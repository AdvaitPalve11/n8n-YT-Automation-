  "script": "Let me tell you about List of mathematical constants. A mathematical constant is a key number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition, often referred to by a symbol (e.g., an alphabet letter), or by mathematicians' names to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems. For example, the constant \u03c0 may be defined as the ratio of the length of a circle's circumference to its diameter. The following list includes a decimal expansion and set containing each number, ordered by year of discovery. The column headings may be clicked to sort the table alphabetically, by decimal value, or by set. This concept is fundamental to mathematics and continues to fascinate researchers and enthusiasts worldwide. Understanding List of mathematical constants opens doors to deeper mathematical insights."
